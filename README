gPodder 4 for Sailfish OS
=========================

This repository contains the platform-specific customizations and packaging for
running gPodder 4 on Sailfish OS. Python 3.3.3 and PyOtherSide is already included
in the device repositories starting with Sailfish OS 1.0.3.8.

To build, make sure you have make and rpm installed, then:

    make -f dist.mk

This should give you an installable .rpm file in the current directory.
