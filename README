gPodder 4 for Sailfish OS
=========================

This repository contains the platform-specific customizations and packaging for
running gPodder 4 on Sailfish OS.

On Sailfish OS, we take Python and PyOtherSide from the mer-python3 project.
Qt 5 is already shipped with the OS, so no need to package it up separately.

To enable mer-python3 on a device, use:
